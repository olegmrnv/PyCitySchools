# City Schools
In this activity data is being provided in a form of csv files and located in Resources folder. I use Python libraries (Pandas and NumPy) to analyze various of factors. Each segment starts with tasks that need to be accomplished and follows with my code. I also used Jupyter Notebook as my working environment. Please refer to the following file: PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb
